Vim
===
Install a customized Vim environment.

Installation
-------------
Firstly, open the setup.sh script and ensure that all the dependencies that are listed in the Dependencies section are installed on the target machine.

Then, from the directory that this README file exists (dotfiles/vim), execute the following command:

    /bin/sh setup.sh

Notes
-----
If there are any visual problems when using Vim inside Konsole (https://konsole.kde.org), install and use the Solarized Dark coloscheme as appearance for Konsole. For more information check the Github repository of the Solazired terminal theme for KDE 4's Konsole terminal client (https://github.com/phiggins/konsole-colors-solarized).
